Problem Overview
The Word Break Problem is a classic dynamic programming and string manipulation challenge. Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict (a list of strings), the goal is to determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note : The same word may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
